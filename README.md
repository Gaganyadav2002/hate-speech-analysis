# hate-speech-analysis
The goal of this project is to develop a system that can accurately identify and classify hate speech in online platforms. 
We will be collecting data from various online sources and manually labeling them as either hate speech or non-hate speech to create a training dataset. We will then preprocess the data by removing stop words, stemming, and other text cleaning techniques to ensure that the data is in a suitable format for analysis.Once we have a preprocessed dataset, we will use TF-IDF vectorization to convert the text data into numerical features. We will then apply the four machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, naive Bayes, SVM, and random forest, to develop models that can accurately classify hate speech in online communication. We will evaluate the performance of each model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
